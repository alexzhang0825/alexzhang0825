# Contributions

## Red Wine Quality Prediction
This repository is for a data analysis project on red wine quality prediction using different machine learning model. The project itself is nothing sophisticated as the primary focus was on creating a reproducible analysis report.

My specific contributions were:
- Fine-tuned parameters of different machine learning models for classification (Logistic Regression, SVM RBF, kNN, Decision Tree)
- Wrote multiple test functions for different functionalities
- Helped make the report reproducible using jupyter book
- Set up proper instructions for reproducing the report under virtual environment

## World Happiness Tracker
This repository is for a visualization dashboard of a world happiness level data. The dashboard is interactive and allows the user to see trends and rankings based on user selections.

My specific contributions were:
- Developed dash module for a interactive `pandas` table in the dashboard
- Helped track different changes implemented as reflection

## Sentiment Analysis Model Development (Private repository due to confidentiality)
This repository is for our capstone project for the MDS program at UBC. We wanted to pave way for an even bigger model that can help determine a potential customer interested in buying a real estate listing as well as recommend different estates based on customer demands. Due to time constraint, we could not do everything. We focused on using fine-tuned and zero-shot models to predict customer interest level (labelled as three levels: cold, warm, and hot) with agent-customer text history as our data set.

My specific contributions were:
- Cleaned up and aggregated conversation log data set for compatibility with models
- Engineered features indicating agent response time and frequency for modelling
- Restructured the repository and modularized python codes from notebooks into scripts for reproducibility
