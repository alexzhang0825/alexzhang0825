# Contributions

## [Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction)
This repository is for a data analysis project on red wine quality prediction using different machine learning model. The project itself is nothing sophisticated as the primary focus was on creating a reproducible analysis report.

- Fine-tuned parameters of different machine learning models for classification (Logistic Regression, SVM RBF, kNN, Decision Tree)
- Wrote multiple test functions for different functionalities
- Helped make the report reproducible using jupyter book
- Set up proper instructions for reproducing the report under virtual environment
